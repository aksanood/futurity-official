      question: 'Is the design really bespoke?',

      question: 'How fast is \'Fast Delivery\'?',
      answer: 'While every project is different, we pride ourselves on fast delivery. Once we complete the discovery phase, we will give you a clear and realistic timeline for launch.'

    {
      question: 'What if I need more than 3 pages?',

    {
      question: 'Who owns the website once it\'s built?',
      answer: 'You do. Upon receipt of the final payment, all work products and deliverables created by us become your exclusive property.'
